# alarmsystem-prototype
This is the repository for the prototype of the Integrated Alarm System (IAS)

The purpose of the prototype is to double check the architecture we have in mind, spot and fix issues.
At the present stage we are not sure if the prototype will never go in operations.

:exclamation: The prototype project is abandoned in favor of the production one.
